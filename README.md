## Design

### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These iclude the icons to give the user the option to mute and unmute the quiz sounds. 

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I used coolers contrast checker to optimize, results for green background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-6e9075 "Adjusted colour"), results for light gray background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-d3d3d3 "Adjusted colour"), results for correct answer background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-228C22 "Adjusted colour"), results for incorrect answer background can be viewed  [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-e10000 "Adjusted colour").

![Colour Pallet](/documentation/project-colors.png)

- #6e9075 - This colour will be used as the main background colour with opacity of 0.9.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as text colour in Next button.
- #000000 - This colour will be used as text colour in quiz buttons.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for background color of Next button.
- #228C22 - This colour will be used for correct answers.
- #E10000 - This colour will be used for incorrect answers.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the Samsung Galaxy S9 (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/).

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
