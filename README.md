### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the Samsung Galaxy S9 (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/).

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
